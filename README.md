tools-generic
=============

A repo of curated generic OpenStack Operations Tools

These have been verified that do what they say, pass our coding standards and have been found useful by the Operating Community.

For contributing other tools, generally you should submit them to the `osops-tools-contrib repo <https://github.com/openstack/osops-tools-contrib>`_ first.

Please see the wiki page at `https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Osops#Overview_moving_code <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Osops#Overview_moving_code>`_
for more details about how code is promoted up to the generic repo.
